# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Part 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
This analysis is to identifiy ideal vehicle performance. Multiple metrics such as vehicle length, weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance, collected for each vehicle. using knowledge of R desgined a linear regress to predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes using several variables from csv file. 

Linear Regression:

  1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variancee to the mpg values in the dataset?
  
  Statistical significance on vehicle length, weight, ground clearnracne and also weight has some significant

  2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
  
  The slope of the linear model has p-value(5.35e-11)

The slope of the linear model has a p-value(3.35e-11) for that reason it is not considered zero. We need to consider that significance level is lower than 0.05.

    Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

    What metric or metrics are you going to test?

    What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?

    What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?

    What data is needed to run the statistical test?
